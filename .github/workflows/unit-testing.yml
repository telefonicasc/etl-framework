    # FIXME: it would be great to use cache to avoid re-creating the virtualenv
    # and installing dependencies every time. We know the syphar/restore-virtualenv@v1 and 
    # syphar/restore-pip-download-cache@v1 actions, but it seems it only works if
    # dependencies are in requeriments.txt file (and in this case we have them in setup.py)
